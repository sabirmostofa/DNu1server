Hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul
and sings the tune without words
and never stops at all

ON this long storm the rainbow rose,	
On this late morn the sun;	
The clouds, like listless elephants,	
Horizons straggled down.	
  
The birds rose smiling in their nests,
The gales indeed were done;	
Alas! how heedless were the eyes	
On whom the summer shone!	
  
The quiet nonchalance of death	
No daybreak can bestir;
The slow archangel’s syllables	
Must awaken her.


I ENVY seas whereon he rides,	
  I envy spokes of wheels	
Of chariots that him convey,	
  I envy speechless hills	
  
That gaze upon his journey;
  How easy all can see	
What is forbidden utterly	
  As heaven, unto me!	
  
I envy nests of sparrows	
  That dot his distant eaves,
The wealthy fly upon his pane,	
  The happy, happy leaves	
  
That just abroad his window	
  Have summer’s leave to be,	
The earrings of Pizarro	  
  Could not obtain for me.
